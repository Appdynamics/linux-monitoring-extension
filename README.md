# AppDynamics Linux Monitoring Extension

This extension works only with the standalone machine agent. It has been tested against Linux 2.6.32 on Ubuntu; info to be updated as tests against other distributions and Linux versions are completed.

# Use Case

The Linux monitoring extension gathers metrics for a Linux machine and sends them to the AppDynamics Metric Browser.

## Pre-requisites
Before the extension is installed, the prerequisites mentioned [here](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/Extensions-Prerequisites-Guide/ta-p/35213) need to be met. Please do not proceed with the extension installation if the specified prerequisites are not met.

## Installation

1. To build from source, clone this repository and run 'mvn clean install'. This will produce a LinuxMonitor-VERSION.zip in the target directory. Alternatively, download the latest release archive from [Github](https://github.com/Appdynamics/linux-monitoring-extension/releases)
2. Unzip LinuxMonitor.zip and copy the 'LinuxMonitor' directory to `<MACHINE_AGENT_HOME>/monitors/`
3. Configure the extension by referring to the below section.
4. Restart the Machine Agent. 
 
In the AppDynamics Metric Browser, look for: Application Infrastructure Performance  | \<Tier\> | Custom Metrics | Linux (or the custom path you specified).


## Configuration

Note : Please make sure not to use tab (\t) while editing yaml files. You can validate the yaml file using a [yaml validator](http://yamllint.com/)

1. Configure the Linux Extension by editing the config.yml file in `<MACHINE_AGENT_HOME>/monitors/LinuxMonitor/`.
2. The metricPrefix of the extension has to be configured as specified [here](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-do-I-troubleshoot-missing-custom-metrics-or-extensions/ta-p/28695#Configuring%20an%20Extension). Please make sure that the right metricPrefix is chosen based on your machine agent deployment, otherwise this could lead to metrics not being visible in the controller.
3. Configure the path to the config.yml file by editing the <task-arguments> in the monitor.xml file in the `<MACHINE_AGENT_HOME>/monitors/LinuxMonitor/` directory. Below is the sample

     ```
     <task-arguments>
         <!-- config file-->
         <argument name="config-file" is-required="true" default-value="monitors/LinuxMonitor/config.yml" />
          ....
     </task-arguments>
    ```
4. filters: Filters for disk, CPU and mountedNFS can be configured in config.yml to fetch data only for particular entities. Be default, all entities are set to report.
5. All metrics to be reported are configured in metrics.xml. Users can remove entries from metrics.xml to stop the metric from reporting.

## Support Tickets
If after going through the [Troubleshooting Document](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-troubleshoot-missing-custom-metrics-or-extensions-metrics/ta-p/28695) you have not been able to get your extension working, please file a ticket and add the following information.

Please provide the following in order for us to assist you better.

    1. Stop the running machine agent.
    2. Delete all existing logs under <MachineAgent>/logs.
    3. Please enable debug logging by editing the file <MachineAgent>/conf/logging/log4j.xml. Change the level value of the following <logger> elements to debug.
        <logger name="com.singularity">
        <logger name="com.appdynamics">
    4. Start the machine agent and please let it run for 10 mins. Then zip and upload all the logs in the directory <MachineAgent>/logs/*.
    5. Attach the zipped <MachineAgent>/conf/* directory here.
    6. Attach the zipped <MachineAgent>/monitors/ExtensionFolderYouAreHavingIssuesWith directory here.
